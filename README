This is a project where I put a bunch of the code I did. General storage library
to put reusable pieces of code.

The project builds a static library and a DLL. It's the same code but allows the
user to choose between static and shared libs.

There is also a console project to debug the project and DLL loading techniques.

Building : 
To build the project, CMAKE is needed.

From the src/ dir :
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
