Project : LibTech - A library of code to bootstrap projects

This is a project where I put a bunch of the code I did. General storage library
to put reusable pieces of code.

The project builds a static library and a DLL. It's the same code but allows the
user to choose between static and shared libs.

There is also a console project to debug the project and DLL loading techniques.

Building :

The project depends on a few git submodules, GLFW for example if the LIBTECH_SUPPORT_OPENGL is selected. Before
initializing the CMAKE project, don't forget to init and update the submodules first.

git submodule init
git submodule update --recursive

To build the project, CMake is needed.

From the src/ dir :
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..

Using in other projects :
Thanks to CMake, importing the library in other projects is extremely easy.

In your CMakeLists.txt add the lines

add_subdirectory(libtech)
include_directories(libtech/include)
target_link_libraries(Scratch LIBTECH ${LIBTECH_LIBRARIES})

That's it. I suggest getting a git submodule into your project and linking that checked out folder in your cmake libs.
